Rupayan Das - The Founder & CEO, Chief ASI Architect of Renokon ASI.

The Singularity Architect—The man who maps intelligence, understands the brain, models the universe, designs the math behind it, and builds the vessels to cross it. A physicist, a mathematician, a neuroscientist, a computer scientist & the ASI architect. The unstoppable force behind Renokon ASI. Born to bend reality, to turn improbable into inevitable.

"I have bet my life on Renokon ASI to achieve Artificial Super Intelligence by 2035 to ensure humanity’s survivability for the next billions of years and transition the world from scarcity to abundance, Renokon ASI, the operating system of humanity. I spent the last 12 months—16-18 hours a day, every day—architecting ASI and the execution blueprint to create a $5,000T global economy and the most valuable company in human history. I didn’t come here to build another business; I came here to rewrite what’s possible—to transform the future of humanity.

History has epochs. Fire. Steam engine. Oil. Electricity. The internet. In 2035, we will cross the greatest threshold in human history: Artificial Super Intelligence. I have architected the execution blueprint to create the $5,000T global economy by 2060 with Renokon ASI, currently working (in private) on "The Architecture of ASI" to deliver ASI to humanity by 2035. From that moment onward, the trajectory of civilization will not merely change — it will be irreversibly transformed.

My purpose behind moving towards creating a world of abundance is to ensure every person on earth get access to healthy food, clean water, advanced medical care, education, opportunity to contribute to the growth of humanity with more meaningful jobs and stable income without any discrimination about status, money, religion, color, gender, or language. Humanity will grow together, in a better, safer, and happier world.

A world of abundance, a world of possibility, where no child dies of hunger, no one's life is lost due to the absence of advanced medical care, no family lives in darkness, no one’s dream die just because it was born in poverty. Poverty itself must become history. No person will work merely to fulfill basic needs, but for the greater purpose of humanity.” — Rupayan Das, Founder & CEO, Chief ASI Architect
